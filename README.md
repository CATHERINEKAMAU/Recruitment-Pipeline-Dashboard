# 📊 Recruitment Pipeline & Efficiency Dashboard
*Interactive Business Intelligence solution built with Looker Studio*

## 📌 Project Overview

## 🔍 Key Insights
* **Referrals are the Quality Driver:** Referrals and Careers Page candidates convert to hires more efficiently than high-volume sources like LinkedIn.
* **Stage Velocity Bottlenecks:** Technical interviews and offer stages take the longest, slowing overall hiring speed.
* **Engineering Leads Demand:** Engineering roles account for the highest hiring demand and the longest time to close.
* **Pipeline Momentum:** A strong active pipeline of 38 candidates highlights the importance of fast early-stage screening to maintain momentum.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technical Implementation
* **Looker Studio:** Primary tool for interactive data visualization and dashboarding.
* **Pivot Table Heatmaps:** Implemented to instantly flag process friction points like the 16-day peak in HR offers.
* **Conditional Formatting:** Applied to visualize "Days in Process" where darker colors highlight slower stages.
* **Data Blending:** Integrated sourcing and departmental data to calculate conversion rates.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
* **Speed to Offer:** Shorten approval and offer timelines to reduce late-stage candidate drop-off.
* **Sourcing Priority:** Continue prioritizing referral-driven sourcing to maintain high hire quality.
* **Coordination Improvement:** Improve interview scheduling, particularly for technical assessments, to accelerate decisions.
