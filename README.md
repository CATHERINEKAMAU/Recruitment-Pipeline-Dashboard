# 📊 Recruitment Pipeline & Efficiency Dashboard
*Turning hiring data into human-centered insight*

## 📌 Project Overview
Hiring is not just about filling roles — it is a journey experienced by both candidates and hiring teams.  
This project explores the recruitment pipeline from application to hire, focusing on how candidates move through each stage, where time is spent, and which sourcing channels lead to successful outcomes.

Built using Looker Studio, the dashboard provides a clear and intuitive view of hiring performance, helping teams identify bottlenecks, maintain candidate momentum, and make more informed recruitment decisions.

## 🔍 What the Data Reveals

- **Quality over volume:** Referral and careers page candidates convert to hires more efficiently than high-volume job boards like LinkedIn.  
- **Interview stages slow progress:** Technical interviews and offer stages account for the longest delays in the hiring journey.  
- **Engineering drives demand:** Engineering roles represent the largest share of hiring activity and take the longest to close.  
- **Early stages shape outcomes:** A strong active pipeline highlights the importance of fast screening to keep candidates engaged.

## 🧠 Why This Matters
The insights suggest that hiring speed is influenced more by internal coordination than by candidate availability. Improving interview flow and approval timelines can significantly enhance candidate experience and reduce time-to-hire without increasing application volume.
