*Interactive Business Intelligence solution built with Looker Studio*

## 📌 Project Overview
[cite_start]This dashboard explores the recruitment journey from application to hire, highlighting how candidates move through each stage, where time is spent, and which sourcing channels lead to successful outcomes[cite: 3]. [cite_start]It is designed to give hiring teams a clear, human-centered view of the hiring process and support more informed recruitment decisions[cite: 3]. [cite_start]Ultimately, this dashboard isn't just about numbers; it’s about understanding the human experience within our hiring process[cite: 3].

## 🔍 Key Insights
* [cite_start]**Referrals are the Quality Driver:** While LinkedIn provides the highest volume of candidates (50 total applications), **Referrals** and **Careers Page** candidates convert to hires significantly more efficiently[cite: 1, 3].
* [cite_start]**Stage Velocity Bottlenecks:** The **Offer** and **Technical Interview** stages take the longest—averaging up to **16 days** in HR and **14 days** in Marketing[cite: 2, 3].
* [cite_start]**Engineering Leads Demand:** Engineering represents the highest volume of hiring activity, showing a robust pipeline but also a closing time of **21 days** for the final hire stage[cite: 1, 3].
* [cite_start]**Pipeline Momentum:** A strong active pipeline of **38 candidates** highlights the importance of fast early-stage screening to maintain candidate engagement[cite: 3].

## 🛠️ Tools & Technical Implementation
* [cite_start]**Looker Studio:** Primary tool for interactive data visualization[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**Pivot Table Heatmaps:** Implemented to instantly flag process friction points across departments[cite: 2, 3].
* [cite_start]**Conditional Formatting:** Applied a 3-point color scale to visualize "Days in Process" (Darker = Slower)[cite: 2].
* **Data Blending:** Integrated sourcing and departmental data to calculate ROI and conversion rates.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
* [cite_start]**Speed to Offer:** Shorten approval and offer timelines—specifically targeting the 16-day peak in HR—to reduce late-stage candidate drop-off[cite: 3].
* [cite_start]**Sourcing Priority:** Continue prioritizing referral-driven sourcing to maintain high hire quality[cite: 3].
* [cite_start]**Coordination Improvement:** Improve interview scheduling, particularly for technical assessments, to accelerate final hiring decisions[cite: 3].
